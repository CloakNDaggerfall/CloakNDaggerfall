I'm just a person. Nothing special about me. A motorhead that's a fan of Motorhead. A fan of Jeff Minter and psychoactives. I believe that everyone has or should have a freedom of choice. Every project I've ever worked on had ended without a choice. This time that changes. I'm trying to break computing from the grip of monotony, corporate sanitation, censorship. Some of the greatest innovations happen after a 5 day bender, right after The shadows have gone to sleep. Programming has gone worse than soft, it's gone corporate. Boards of morons decide what will and will not exist because of their corporate messaging and level of brainwashing at college. The stuff here isn't going to blow you away, It's more than likely be some of the most inane trash you've seen. Innovation from bare bones up. We must go to it's basic form and see what all we can accomplish. My first OS? PC GEOS. An awesome OS that time seemingly forgot.  z-->
